# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm APISIT (BEAM)! 

### ðŸ‘€ About Me
I'm passionate about **computational structures in civil engineering** and exploring the potential of **AI and machine learning** in this field. My primary interest lies in integrating AI to solve complex problems in civil engineering, especially focusing on **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and other machine learning techniques.

### ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Learning
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Applying PINNs for structural analysis in civil engineering.
- **Machine Learning in Civil Engineering**: Leveraging AI to improve structural analysis, design, and prediction models.
